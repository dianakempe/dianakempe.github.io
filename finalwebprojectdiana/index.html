	<p>It was just a few days ago that Ariana Grande subtweeted her ex Pete Davidson—the couple unexpectedly called off their engagement last month—in response to Davidson making light of their failed relationship during a promo clip for SNL. (In the video, Davidson asks musical guest Maggie Rogers to marry him, and when she denies him, he replies, “0 for 3.”) Now, the singer surprised fans by releasing a whole new single last night, 30 minutes or so before SNL, aptly named after her viral tweet (“thank u, next”)—and it pays homage to all her past failed relationships, and the lessons she has learned from them.</p>

	<p>Though she seemed to be taking a note out of Taylor Swift’s songbook (and à la Reputation, used headlines about the story, including one from Vogue, as its cover) Grande’s song was not quite the petty breakup anthem many were anticipating, especially given the timing of its release. With lyrics such as, “One taught me love, one taught me patience, and one taught me pain,” the singer makes peace with her past, and her old flames: Davidson, Big Sean, and the late Mac Miller, who passed away in September.</p>

	<p>Grande and Davidson were engaged after dating for only a few weeks. The couple had moved in together, and adopted a pet pig, named Piggy Smallz. Since the split, Davidson has been using comedy to cope with the breakup, while Grande has kept relatively mum—until now.</p>

	<p>Below, see some of the standout lyrics from “Thank U, Next.”</p>

	<p>“Thought I’d end up with Sean, but he wasn’t a match, wrote some songs about Ricky, now I listen and laugh.”</p>

	<p>“Even almost got married, and for Pete I’m so thankful, wish I could say thank you to Malcolm, ’cause he was an angel.”</p>

	<p>“One taught me love, one taught me patience, and one taught me pain, now I’m so amazing.”</p>

	<p>“Thank you, next, I’m so fuckin’ grateful for my ex.”</p>

	<p>“Plus I met someone else, we havin’ better discussions, I know they say I move on too fast, but this one gon’ last, ’cause her name is Ari, and I’m so good with that.”</p>

	<p>“She taught me love, she taught me patience, and she handles pain, that shit’s amazing, I’ve loved and I’ve lost, but that’s not what I see, just look what I’ve found, ain’t no need for searching.” </p>
